/// A reusable buffer for scoring operations to avoid allocations in the hot path.
///
/// `ScoringBuffer` holds pre-allocated arrays used during scoring.
/// By reusing the same buffer across multiple ``FuzzyMatcher/score(_:against:buffer:)``
/// calls, you eliminate heap allocations in the hot path.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Create a buffer using ``FuzzyMatcher/makeBuffer()`` and pass it by reference
/// to the `score` method. The buffer automatically expands if it encounters
/// strings longer than its initial capacity.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
/// let query = matcher.prepare("config")
///
/// // Create a reusable buffer
/// var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()
///
/// // Score many candidates with zero allocations
/// for candidate in candidates {
///     if let match = matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer) {
///         print("\(candidate): \(match.score)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Concurrent Usage
///
/// For concurrent scoring, each task must have its own buffer. The buffer
/// itself is `Sendable`, but concurrent mutation is not safe.
///
/// ```swift
/// let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
/// let query = matcher.prepare("data")
///
/// await withTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
///     for chunk in chunks {
///         group.addTask {
///             // Each task creates its own buffer
///             var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()
///
///             for candidate in chunk {
///                 matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer)
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Memory Management
///
/// Buffers grow to accommodate the longest input seen and periodically shrink
/// when recent usage is much smaller than allocated capacity. After every
/// `shrinkCheckInterval` calls (default: 1000), if current capacity exceeds
/// 4x the high-water mark over that interval, the buffer shrinks to 2x the
/// high-water mark. This prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running
/// processes that occasionally see large inputs.
