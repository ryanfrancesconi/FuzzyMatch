/// A scored match result containing the score and match kind.
///
/// `ScoredMatch` is returned by ``FuzzyMatcher/score(_:against:buffer:)`` when
/// a candidate successfully matches the query. It contains both the numeric score
/// and the type of match that was found.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The score is a value between 0.0 and 1.0:
/// - `1.0`: Perfect match (exact or very close)
/// - `0.7-0.99`: Good match with minor differences
/// - `0.3-0.69`: Acceptable match with notable differences
/// - Below `minScore`: Not returned (filtered out)
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
/// let query = matcher.prepare("usr")
/// var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()
///
/// if let match = matcher.score("user", against: query, buffer: &buffer) {
///     print("Score: \(match.score)")      // e.g., 0.75
///     print("Kind: \(match.kind)")   // .prefix
///
///     switch match.kind {
///     case .exact:
///         print("Exact match!")
///     case .prefix:
///         print("Matched at the beginning")
///     case .substring:
///         print("Matched somewhere in the middle")
///     case .acronym:
///         print("Matched word initials")
///     case .alignment:
///         print("Matched via local alignment")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Sorting Results
///
/// `ScoredMatch` conforms to `Comparable`, so you can sort results by score:
///
/// ```swift
/// let results = matcher.topMatches(candidates, against: query)
/// // Results are sorted highest score first
/// ```
public struct ScoredMatch: Sendable, Hashable, Comparable, Codable, CustomStringConvertible {
    /// The match score between 0.0 (worst) and 1.0 (best).
    ///
    /// In **edit distance** mode, the score is derived from the Damerau-Levenshtein distance:
    /// - Base score: `1.0 - (editDistance / queryLength)`
    /// - Weighted by ``EditDistanceConfig/prefixWeight`` or ``EditDistanceConfig/substringWeight``
    /// - Enhanced with position-based bonuses (word boundaries, consecutive matches)
    ///
    /// In **Smith-Waterman** mode, the score is derived from the local alignment DP:
    /// - Raw integer score from matched characters, boundary bonuses, and gap penalties
    /// - Normalized to 0.0–1.0 against a theoretical maximum
    ///
    /// In both modes, an exact match always has score 1.0.
    public let score: Double

    /// The kind of match that was found.
    ///
    /// Indicates where in the candidate the query matched:
    /// - `.exact`: Query equals candidate (case-insensitive)
    /// - `.prefix`: Query matches the beginning of candidate (edit distance mode)
    /// - `.substring`: Query matches somewhere within candidate (edit distance mode)
    /// - `.acronym`: Query matches word-initial characters (both modes)
    /// - `.alignment`: Query matched via local alignment (Smith-Waterman mode)
    ///
    /// See ``MatchKind`` for details.
    public let kind: MatchKind

    /// Creates a new scored match.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - score: The match score between 0.0 and 1.0.
    ///   - kind: The kind of match.

    ///
    /// This enables sorting match results from lowest to highest score.
    /// For highest-first sorting, use `>` or `sorted(by: >)`.
    ///

///     print("\(result.candidate): \(result.match.score)")
/// }
